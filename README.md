ElectionTime is a non-partisan website with a mission to inform Canadians about the candidates and parties in their next election, and to encourage all eligible Canadians to vote. ElectionTime works to achieve this by conveniently displaying profiles of candidates and parties in side-by-side comparisons for elections of all types across the country. We want to make it easy for you as a voter to compare and contrast your options before election day.

ElectionTime is strictly non-partisan, is not affiliated with any political party or candidate, and is firmly committed to neutrality. The content of information displayed is provided entirely by the candidates, parties, and their campaigns.
